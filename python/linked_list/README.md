## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
The approach I took was to write the code first with an idea of getting to the end point.


## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
```
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value, next=None):
        self.value = value
        self.next = next


class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def insert(self, next):
        self.head = Node(next, self.head)

    def includes(self, value=None):
        current = self.head
        while current:
            if current.value == value:
                return True
            current = current.next
        return False

    def __str__(self):
        current = self.head
        output = ''
        while current:
            output += '{ ' + current.value + ' } -> '
            current = current.next
        output += 'NULL'
        return output

# Challenge Summary 07
k-th value from the end of a linked list.

- Do all your work in a your data-structures-and-algorithms public repository.

![Linked List - KTH - Whiteboard](../wireframes/code-ch-07.png)

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
The approach I took was to write the code first with an idea of getting to the end point.

The O space i believe is O(n) with the length of the linked list in question determines the run time.

## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
```
    def kth_from_end(self, k_element):
        length_count = 0
        temp = self.head
        while (temp):
            temp = temp.next
            length_count += 1
        if length_count < k_element:
            return IndexError
        elif k_element < 0:
            return None
        else:
            index_from_end = k_element
            index = length_count - index_from_end
            item = self.head
            for x in range(index-1):
                # item += '.next'
                if item.next:
                    item = item.next

            return item.value
```
