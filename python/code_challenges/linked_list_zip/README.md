# Challenge Summary 08
Zip two linked lists.

## Specifications
- Write a function called zip lists
- Arguments: 2 linked lists
- Return: Linked List, zipped as noted below
- Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the zipped list.
- Try and keep additional space down to O(1)
- You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
The approach I took was to write the code first with an idea of getting to the end point.

The O space i believe is O(n) with the length of the linked list in question determines the run time.

## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->

TBD
