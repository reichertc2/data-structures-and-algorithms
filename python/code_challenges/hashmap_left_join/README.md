# Challenge Summary 33
Hashmap Left Join

## Specifications
- Read all of these instructions carefully.
- Name things exactly as described.
- Do all your work in a your data-structures-and-algorithms public repository.
- Create a new branch in your repo named as noted below.
- Follow the language-specific instructions for the challenge type listed below.
- Update the “Table of Contents” - in the README at the root of the repository - with a link to this challenge’s README file.

## Feature Tasks
Write a function that LEFT JOINs two hashmaps into a single data structure.

- Write a function called left join
- Arguments: two hash maps
    - The first parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and a synonym of the key as values.
    - The second parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and antonyms of the key as values.
- Return: The returned data structure that holds the results is up to you. It doesn’t need to exactly match the output below, so long as it achieves the LEFT JOIN logic

#### NOTES:
- Combine the key and corresponding values (if they exist) into a new data structure according to LEFT JOIN logic.
- LEFT JOIN means all the values in the first hashmap are returned, and if values exist in the “right” hashmap, they are appended to the result row.
If no values exist in the right hashmap, then some flavor of NULL should be appended to the result row.

## Structure and Testing
Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.##

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
The approach I took was to write the code first with an idea of getting to the end point.

## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
